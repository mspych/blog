We had our weekly groceries delivered today.
Mind-boggling how much plastic is used for food packaging. 
While it genuinely makes me feel bad about myself for not shopping locally and reducing some of that waste it‚Äôs up to supermarkets to come up with holistic solutions to takle the problem. 

Shifting topics. Let‚Äôs talk about travel.
Here are my tips on how to reduce plastic usage when traveling:

1. Get a large bottle of [Dr Bronner's Organic Castile Soap](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=dr+bronner+castile+soap&crid=15YSEC9GYIS2Q&sprefix=dr+bronner+cast%2Caps%2C324&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_15). It‚Äôs free from nasty stuff and super concentrated so you only need few drops. Highly recommend the almond scent. It‚Äôs our favourite.  
2. Buy reusable bottle like [Humangear GoToob](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Humangear+GoToob&ref=nb_sb_noss) and fill it with Castile Soap. They come in various sizes. We have a small (37ml) and large (100ml) one. I suggest going for 2 smaller ones as they give you greater control over dispensing. With large one you end up applying too much. 
Two small ones should easily cover 7-10 days trips when traveling as a couple! Not only you won‚Äôt need to worry about that nasty stuff in most hotel‚Äôs toiletries, freeing some space in you bag but ultimately you are saving the üåç

Climate change is a hot topic. It‚Äôs good. Raising awareness is good.
