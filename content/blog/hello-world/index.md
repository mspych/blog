This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

When researching the platform for this blog I considered two most popular static site generators - Jekyll and Hugo.<br/>
Why static?

>Static site generators are an alternative to database-driven content management systems, such as WordPress and Drupal. In such systems, content is managed and stored in a database. <br/>
>Static site generators, on the other hand, generate HTML pages during a build process. Static pages eliminate the latency that databases introduce.

'Static' is simply the way to go.

Later I discovered Gatsby (Gatsby.js exactly). The new cool in town, that even top brands are using right now.
Just look at the [Braun GatsbyJS eCommerce](https://ca.braun.com/en-ca) or [The Just Do It Promotional Nike Website](https://justdoit.nike.com).


Overall benefits:

- Write in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)  (I understand the basic Syntax but want to create a habit)
- Blazing fast
- Learn modern front-end technologies gradually
- JavaScript everywhere - transferable skills   

Regarding hosting, this website is hosted by Netlify for free! <br/>
Bought the domain via [hover](https://hover.com). They really don't want to [upsell their customers](https://www.hover.com/blog/real-price-of-cheap-domain-name/).
