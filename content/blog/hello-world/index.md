This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

When researching the platform for this blog I considered two most popular static site generators - Jekyll and Hugo.<br/>
Why static?

>Static pages eliminate the latency that databases introduce. Static site generators are an alternative to database-driven content management systems, such as WordPress and Drupal. In such systems, content is managed and stored in a database. When the server receives a request for a particular URL, a software layer retrieves data from the database, merges it with template files, and generates an HTML page as its response.<br/>
>Static site generators, on the other hand, generate HTML pages during a build process. 


Later I discovered Gatsby (Gatsby.js exactly) that even top brands are using right now. Just look at the [Braun GatsbyJS eCommerce](https://ca.braun.com/en-ca) or [The Just Do It Promotional Nike Website](https://justdoit.nike.com).
'Static' is simply the way to go.

Some benefits:

- Write in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)  (I understand the basic Syntax but want to create a habit)
- Blazing fast
- Learn modern front-end technologies gradually
- JavaScript everywhere - transferable skills
