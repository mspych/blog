This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

When researching the platform for this blog I considered two most popular static site generators - Jekyll and Hugo.<br/> 
Later I discovered Gatsby (Gatsby.js exactly) that even top brands are using right now. Just look at the [Braun GatsbyJS eCommerce](https://ca.braun.com/en-ca) or [The Just Do It Promotional Nike Website](https://justdoit.nike.com).
'Static' is simply the way to go.

Some benefits:

- Write in Markdown  (I understand the basic Syntax but want to create a habit)
- Blazing fast
- Learn modern front-end technologies gradually
- JavaScript everywhere - transferable skills
