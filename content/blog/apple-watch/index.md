description: "Few thoughts on the Apple Watch"
---

Just over a year ago I bought the Apple Watch Series 4 with cellular.
It replaced my First Generation Apple Watch (aka Series 0) Iâ€™ve had since launching in 2015.
 
I know you canâ€™t really compare the old with new but the change in performance was huge.  The addition of cellular connectivity means I can make and receive calls and use data without my phone. 

Here are some other features and how I use the watch daily: 
* Listening to music, podcasts and audiobooks on the go
* Unlocking my mac (honestly feels like magic) 
* Tracking all workouts and steps (I do like to [close my rings](https://www.apple.com/uk/watch/close-your-rings/))
* Silent Alarm (no sound). The watch will vibrate (give haptic feedback). While I wake up without the alarm (#routines) itâ€™s super handy if you donâ€™t want to wake your spouse when catching that early morning flight.
* On few occasions I will use the flashlight. Again, helpful when you donâ€™t want to blinded by the lights in the room during the night when navigating that weird hotel room layout. 
* Changing tracks and controlling the volume on any device thatâ€™s currently playing 
* Capturing ideas using [Drafts](https://birchtree.me/blog/drafts-5-on-apple-watch-review/)

I really like this device separation. Not having to pick up the phone first thing in morning, resisting the temptations of plethora of apps waiting for my attention.
I can go for a run while listening to a podcast or Audible (paired with my AirPods), pickup bread from a local bakery (paid with ï£¿ Pay) on the way back and every time it feels I'm a man from the future ðŸ’¥
